Splitwise-CashFlow-Minimizer
Overview
The Splitwise-CashFlow-Minimizer is a C++ implementation designed to simplify group expense settlements. This project helps reduce the total number of transactions required to settle debts among a group of people, making it easier to manage shared expenses. By optimizing the cash flow, it ensures that the minimum number of payments is made, saving time and reducing complexity.

Features
Optimal Transaction Reduction: Automatically calculates the minimal set of transactions needed to settle all debts.
Efficient Algorithms: Utilizes graph-based algorithms to find the optimal way to balance expenses.
User-Friendly Input/Output: Easy-to-understand input format for entering group expenses and debts.
Scalable: Capable of handling a large number of participants and transactions.
How It Works
Input: Enter the debts between individuals as a matrix or a list of transactions.
Processing: The program applies a graph algorithm to minimize the number of transactions.
Output: The minimum number of transactions required to settle all debts is displayed.
Getting Started
Clone this repository and compile the code using a C++ compiler. Follow the instructions in the README to input your groupâ€™s expenses and run the cash flow minimizer.
